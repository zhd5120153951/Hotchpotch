# Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network(RCNN)
This repo is implementations of [Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network for object recognition](http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2015/app/2B_004.pdf). 

**Note:** I have modified a part of architecture.

## Keras
Keras-RCNN is a Keras-implementation.

## TensorFlow
TensorFlow-RCNN is a TensorFlow-implenmentation.

## Data
The data set is [SVHN](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers) downloaded from stanford University
